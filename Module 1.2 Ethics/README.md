# BiotrAIn course: Concepts, approaches and applications of Artificial Intelligence in bioscience

### Pilot Course: June 16-20, 2025 - San Jos√©, Costa Rica

## Module #: Responsible use of AI

This module explores the ethical challenges, social impacts, and regulatory issues surrounding the development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
It aims to promote critical reflection on how AI technologies are designed, implemented, and governed across different contexts, with special attention to issues of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and social justice.
You will be introduced to real-world case studies, interdisciplinary debates, and national/international frameworks that guide responsible AI development.
