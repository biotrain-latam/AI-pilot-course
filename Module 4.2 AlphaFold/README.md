## Materials and tutorials

**Before the course:** Install and learn how to use PyMOL.

Go to [https://www.pymol.org/](https://www.pymol.org/), click the **Download** button, and choose **PyMOL 3.1** and the version corresponding to your operating system.
Then, to obtain a license, go to [https://pymol.org/edu/](https://pymol.org/edu/) and fill out the form. You will receive an email with information on how to download the license.
Run PyMOL and follow the instructions to load the license.
Then complete the tutorial at [https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Biochemistry\_student\_intro](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Biochemistry_student_intro) to become familiar with PyMOL. Follow the instructions up to the section titled **“The Faster Way.”**
