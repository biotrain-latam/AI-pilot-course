They usually employ high-throughput techniques, such as DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry, to generate information about all molecules, genes, cells, organisms, and more. This information can be analyzed using bioinformatics methods to inform the structure, function and dynamics of the biological entities.\n","\n","In microbiome research, because isolating and cultivating all microbes in a habitat is usually infeasible, omics are essential tools to characterize the microbiome (the name of which already indicates this nature). The prefix \"**meta**-\" is usually added to an omic to indicate the study of biological entities from all microorganisms within the environment (e.g., [metagenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics)). Omics for microbiota can be employed in combination with omics for their host or the environment to profile a more comprehensive image of the biological system.\n","\n","Depending on the biological molecules it studies, the most common omics for host and microbiota include:\n","\n","- Molecule: DNA - mRNA - protein - metabolite\n","- (Host) ome: genome - transcriptome - proteome - metabolome\n","- (Microbiota) ome: metagenome - metatranscriptome - metaproteome - (meta)metabolome\n","\n","In this section, we will use a real-world study -- the **Earth Microbiome Project 500** ([EMP500](https://earthmicrobiome.org/emp500/)), as an example to explore various omic data types. We will navigate the data tables and relevant data files associated with individual omics, discuss the unique challenges and solutions in working with omic data, and compare between omic data types. This process will support the analyses in all subsequent sections."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"495a8b05-1956-4bf4-b376-927e93aa8c7d","metadata":{"id":"495a8b05-1956-4bf4-b376-927e93aa8c7d"},"source":["## Preparation (7 min)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5108ecf9-a855-47c9-8db2-4d2bc07727c1","metadata":{"id":"5108ecf9-a855-47c9-8db2-4d2bc07727c1"},"source":["Install the latest version of scikit-bio if it hasn't been (needed for every Google Colab instance)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"317563d7-f081-4673-a233-62c0c7480d00","metadata":{"id":"317563d7-f081-4673-a233-62c0c7480d00"},"outputs":[],"source":["from importlib.util import find_spec"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"62e25faa-b274-4472-a09b-c7267255d71a","metadata":{"id":"62e25faa-b274-4472-a09b-c7267255d71a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747576970715,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":134816,"user":{"displayName":"Jeanett Daga","userId":"07863803926035571979"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"8ce4ab6e-9911-439d-9c7b-da3312da1e61"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[?25l     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/5.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[90m╺\u001b[0m\u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.1/5.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m32.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[91m╸\u001b[0m \u001b[32m5.4/5.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m92.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m5.4/5.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m57.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Installing build dependencies ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Getting requirements to build wheel ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m11.7/11.7 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m98.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Installing build dependencies ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Getting requirements to build wheel ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Building wheel for scikit-bio (pyproject.toml) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Building wheel for biom-format (pyproject.toml) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n"]}],"source":["if find_spec('skbio') is None:\n","\n","    !pip install -q scikit-bio"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Installation of skbio (cell [2]) takes approx 3 minutes.
