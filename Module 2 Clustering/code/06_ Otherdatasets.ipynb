Cancer omics data is well-suited for this exercise, as projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated high-dimensional datasets from thousands of tumors across many cancer types ([Weinstein et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2764)). The high feature-to-sample ratio in such data makes machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) essential for analysis. These computational approaches are frequently used to identify biologically relevant patterns in cancer research ([Hutter, 2018]().

This landmark project systematically characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples across 33 cancer types ([Weinstein et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2764)). The goal was to create a complete atlas of the molecular aberrations (genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic) that drive different cancers, ultimately identifying commonalities and differences across tumor lineages.\n","\n","![Figure 1.

Conceptual workflow of the Pan-Cancer Atlas project, illustrating the integration of multi-omic data to identify molecular patterns. Source: National Cancer Institute.*\n","\n","The transcriptomic data used here was generated via **RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq)**, a high-throughput technology that quantifies the abundance of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a biological sample. This provides a snapshot of the active genes at a specific moment. For the TCGA project, RNA-Seq was primarily performed on tissue samples from **primary solid tumors**. In many cases, matched **solid tissue normal** samples were also collected from the same patient, providing a crucial baseline for identifying cancer-specific expression changes. For blood cancers like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML), the samples consisted of peripheral blood.\n","\n","**Data Normalization:** The raw RNA-Seq read counts undergo significant computational processing before they are suitable for analysis. The data in TCGA's \"Level 3\" archives, which are commonly used for this type of analysis, have already been processed through a standardized pipeline. This typically includes alignment to a reference genome and normalization to account for technical variations, such as differences in sequencing depth between samples. Common normalization methods used for TCGA data include FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) and TPM (Transcripts Per Million), which make gene expression levels comparable across different samples and genes ([Zhao et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.09.006)). The dataset we are using is pre-processed, allowing us to proceed directly to exploratory analysis.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gLi0TgFHI9Zm"},"id":"gLi0TgFHI9Zm"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Metadata"],"metadata":{"id":"Q7osOBU3Ly5U"},"id":"Q7osOBU3Ly5U"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!wget
