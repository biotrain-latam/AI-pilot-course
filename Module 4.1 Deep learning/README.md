By the end of this course, participants will be able to: 

- **Explain** the theoretical foundations of deep learning and its relationship with artificial intelligence and machine learning.

- **Identify and compare** the main learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement learning) and their applications in biology.

- **Understand** the internal functioning of deep neural networks, including training, optimization, and evaluation processes.

- **Recognize and select** appropriate neural network architectures for different types of biological data.

- **Implement and train** deep learning models for specific biological tasks using PyTorch and Transformers (Hugging Face).

- **Evaluate** deep learning models using appropriate performance metrics and analyze the results to improve model performance.

- **Apply** best practices for reproducibility and interpretability in AI-driven biological research projects.
