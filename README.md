# BiotrAIn course: Concepts, approaches and applications of Artificial Intelligence in bioscience

### Pilot Course: June 16-20, 2025 - San José, Costa Rica

### Background
A group of collaborators from CABANAnet and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) have joined to address some disparities in bioscience-related AI through training. The BiotrAIn project, supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, aims to create a fundamental and sustainable curriculum on artificial intelligence (AI) for bioscientists from Latin America, including data science basics, and leading towards the use and application of AI to better solve biological and biomedical problems.

Our intended impact is that Latin America is able to participate as an equal partner in globally important bioscience projects that use or develop artificial intelligence methods.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, participants will be able to apply foundational concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning to biological data, including situations in the LATAM context, leveraging their existing data analysis skills to:

1. Identify appropriate AI concepts and techniques, ethical aspects, and general usability of AI in bioscience. 

2. Preprocess and analyze biological datasets using clustering algorithms, including regional databases (LATAM).
    
3. Build and evaluate classification models to address biological questions in the LATAM context.
    
4. Apply deep learning models, including tools such as AlphaFold, to analyze complex biological research problems.
    
5. Deliver AI contents with best teaching/learning practices in biological research.
